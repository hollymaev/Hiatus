      </div>
              <p class="textblockcenter"> A visit to the Prophouse Cafe is more about the experience than the coffee/food. If you visit this little cafe, you’ll be surrounded by eclectic, vintage items including a jukebox that consists of hundreds of vinyl for you to choose from. It’s like going to your grandma’s attic and eating a good meal, if you’re grandma was really into cool, kitschy collectibles and bizarre paintings. This is a great place to have a cup of coffee or a cold drink and to play one of the old vintage board games that you’ve probably never heard of before. One such option is “Smokers Wild”, which teaches you about the dangers of smoking. There are also great live shows that go on into the night if you get bored of playing board games.
Location: 1636 Venables Street Why go here? For a different kind of night out with live music and vintage board games Sample menu item: Scones Hours: Mon-Fri: 4pm – 10pm, Sat: 10am – 10pm, Sunday: maybe open, maybe not</p>
